# Sprint Boot Projects

This repository contains a collection of Spring Boot projects that I've learned and developed during my learning journey.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Quiz App](QuizApp)

The app serves as a backend service to manage quizzes, questions, and their related operations. It allows clients to create quizzes, fetch quiz questions, submit quiz responses, and get quiz results.

H2 database is used to store the data. 

### Project 2: [Student Management System](StudentManagementSystem)

This app manages students and uses an in-memory H2 database. It also has a basic UI created with Thymeleaf for easy interaction. Clients can view, add, update, and delete student records through this app.
